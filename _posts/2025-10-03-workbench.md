## My Oak Workbench

I designed and built a solid oak workbench for my studio.  
It has a large surface, storage underneath, and is perfect for woodworking projects.

### Materials

- Oak wood planks
- Screws and nails
- Wood glue
- Varnish

### Process

1. Measure and cut the planks
2. Assemble the frame
3. Attach the surface
4. Sand and varnish
